## Introduction

This guide will take you through the steps necessary to continuously deliver
your software to end users by leveraging Google Kubernetes Engine and Spinnaker
to orchestrate the software delivery pipeline. If you are not familiar with
basic Kubernetes concepts, have a look at Kubernetes 101.

Spinnaker is an open source, cloud-native continuous delivery platform that
helps you release software changes with high velocity and confidence.

It provides two core sets of features: cluster management and deployment
management.

Spinnakerâ€™s deployment management features allow you to construct and manage
continuous delivery workflows.

### Pipelines

Pipelines are the key deployment management construct in Spinnaker. They
consist of a sequence of actions, known as stages. You can pass parameters from
stage to stage along the pipeline. You can start a pipeline manually, or you
can configure it to be started by automatic triggering events, such as a
Jenkins job completing, a new Docker image appearing in your registry, a CRON
schedule, or a stage in another pipeline. You can configure the pipeline to
emit notifications to interested parties at various points during pipeline
execution (such as on pipeline start/complete/fail), by email, SMS or HipChat.

#### Stages

A Stage in Spinnaker is an action that forms an atomic building block for a
pipeline. You can sequence stages in a Pipeline in any order, though some stage
sequences may be more common than others. Spinnaker provides a number of stages
such as Deploy, Resize, Disable, Manual Judgment, and many more. You can see
the full list of stages and read about implementation details for each provider
in the Reference section.

#### Deployment strategies

Spinnaker treats cloud-native deployment strategies as first class constructs,
handling the underlying orchestration such as verifying health checks,
disabling old server groups and enabling new server groups. Spinnaker supports
the red/black (a.k.a. blue/green) strategy, with rolling red/black and canary
strategies in active development.

## Architecture
  Execution of this tutorial will create the following GCP resources.

  ![Spinnaker](img/cicd_spinnaker.png)

## Prerequisites for Spinnaker

* A Google Cloud Platform Account
* A local machine with a bash shell and ssh client
* `git` installed and configured with `user.email` and `user.name`
* You need `wget`. Macs don't come with it so you'll want to `brew install
  wget` if you're on a Mac.

## Deployment

### Install Basic Spinnaker

#### Initial Setup

1. Create a new Google Cloud Platform project:
   [https://console.developers.google.com/project](https://console.developers.google.com/project)

2. Open a Terminal on your local machine.

3. When the shell is open, set up your environment variables.

    ```shell
    PROJECT=[YOUR PROJECT ID HERE] # <<-- update this
    GKE_ZONE=us-west1-b
    GKE_NAME=spinnaker
    SPIN_SA=spinnaker-storage-account
    HALYARD_SA=halyard-service-account
    HALYARD_HOST=halyard-host
    gcloud config set project $PROJECT
    gcloud config set compute/zone $GKE_ZONE
    ```

4. Enable the GCP APIs required for the project. Each line takes a moment. You
   only need to do this **once** for the life of your project.

    ```shell
    # Google Cloud APIs
    gcloud services enable cloudapis.googleapis.com
    # Identity and Access Management (IAM) API
    gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
    # Cloud Resource Manager API
    gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
    # Compute Engine API
    gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
    # Kubernetes Engine API
    gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
    # Container Registry API
    gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
    # Cloud Container Builder API
    gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
    # Stackdriver Logging API
    gcloud services enable logging.googleapis.com
    # Stackdriver Monitoring API
    gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
    # Google Cloud Storage JSON API
    gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com
    # Google Cloud Storage
    gcloud services enable storage-component.googleapis.com
    # Cloud Source Repositories API
    gcloud services enable sourcerepo.googleapis.com
    ```

#### Create a Kubernetes Cluster

1. You'll use Google Container Engine to create and manage your Kubernetes
cluster.

    ```shell
    gcloud container clusters create $GKE_NAME \
       --machine-type=n1-standard-4
    ```

2. Once that operation completes, download the credentials so we can use
Kubernetes' CLI tool `kubectl`.

    ```shell
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_NAME
    ```

3. Confirm that the cluster is running and `kubectl` is working by listing pods:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    You should see the message "No resources found."

#### Create a Service Account for Kubernetes

1. Create the base account.

    ```shell
    kubectl create serviceaccount spinnaker-service-account
    ```

2. Assign the cluster-admin IAM role to the spinnaker-service-account

    ```shell
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding \
     --user system:serviceaccount:default:spinnaker-service-account \
        spinnaker-role \
     --clusterrole cluster-admin
    ```

#### Create a [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)

Create a namespace for the Spinnaker resources that will be created in this
project.

```shell
kubectl create namespace spinnaker
```

#### Get the Token for the Service Account and Store it locally

```shell
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get serviceaccounts spinnaker-service-account \
  -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}')
```

Create a local token file that will be copied-to the Halyard VM and used by
Halyard to provision the Spinnaker cluster.

```shell
kubectl get secret $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | \
    base64 --d > ${GKE_NAME}_token.txt
```

#### Halyard Setup

1. Create a service account for Halyard

    ```shell
    gcloud iam service-accounts create $HALYARD_SA \
      --display-name $HALYARD_SA
    ```

2. Setup the email account for the policy bindings

    ```shell
    HALYARD_SA_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
      --filter="displayName:$HALYARD_SA" \
      --format='value(email)')
    ```

3. Give the account access to download GCS and GCR credentials

    ```shell
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
       --role roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin \
       --member serviceAccount:$HALYARD_SA_EMAIL
    ```

4. Give the account access to download Kubernetes credentials

    ```shell
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
       --role roles/container.admin \
       --member serviceAccount:$HALYARD_SA_EMAIL
    ```

5. Create a service account for Spinnaker

    ```shell
    gcloud iam service-accounts create $SPIN_SA \
       --display-name $SPIN_SA
    ```

6. Setup the email account for the policy bindings

    ```shell
    SPIN_SA_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
       --filter="displayName:$SPIN_SA" \
       --format='value(email)')
    ```

7. Give the account the ability to manage storage

    ```shell
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
       --role roles/storage.admin \
       --member serviceAccount:$SPIN_SA_EMAIL
    ```

8. Give the account access to the higherarchy of the project

    ```shell
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
       --member serviceAccount:$SPIN_SA_EMAIL \
       --role roles/browser
    ```

#### Create the Halyard VM

```shell
gcloud compute instances create $HALYARD_HOST \
    --scopes=cloud-platform \
    --service-account=$HALYARD_SA_EMAIL \
    --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --image-family=ubuntu-1404-lts \
    --machine-type=n1-standard-4
```

Copy the token file over to the VM, and then delete the file locally.

```shell
gcloud compute scp ./${GKE_NAME}_token.txt $HALYARD_HOST:~/

rm ./${GKE_NAME}_token.txt
```

#### SSH to the Halyard VM from your local machine

*Note: You must run this command from your local machine, not the Cloud Shell.*

The rest of the work will be done on the VM that will contain the Halyard
installation. Halyard will allow us to deploy a spinnaker cluster. SSH tunnels
will be set up so you can access Spinnaker's UI from your local machine.

```shell
gcloud compute ssh $HALYARD_HOST
```

#### Set-up the environment on the Halyard VM

If you need to re-login to the Halyard VM, you'll need to set up these
variables again for the new session.

```shell
PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)
GKE_NAME=spinnaker
GKE_ZONE=us-west1-b
SPIN_SA=spinnaker-storage-account
SPIN_SA_DEST=~/.gcp/gcp.json
gcloud config set project $PROJECT
gcloud config set compute/zone $GKE_ZONE
```

#### Install `kubectl`

```shell
KUBECTL_LATEST=$(curl -s \
    https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/\
$KUBECTL_LATEST/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

chmod +x kubectl

sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

#### Install Halyard

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinnaker/halyard/master/install/\
debian/InstallHalyard.sh

sudo bash InstallHalyard.sh

source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Set-up the service account for configuring Spinnaker

```shell
mkdir -p $(dirname $SPIN_SA_DEST)

SPIN_SA_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
    --filter="displayName:$SPIN_SA" \
    --format='value(email)')

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $SPIN_SA_DEST \
    --iam-account $SPIN_SA_EMAIL
```

#### Set the Spinnaker version to latest

```shell
hal config version edit --version $(hal version latest -q)
```

#### Configure Halyard to use [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) for storage

```shell
hal config storage gcs edit \
    --project $(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)') \
    --json-path ~/.gcp/gcp.json

hal config storage edit --type gcs
```

#### Configure Halyard to use the [GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)

```shell
hal config provider docker-registry enable

hal config provider docker-registry account add my-gcr-account \
    --address gcr.io \
    --password-file ~/.gcp/gcp.json \
    --username _json_key \
    --repositories $PROJECT/sample-app
```

#### Get the credentials from `gcloud` so we can use `kubectl`

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_NAME
```

#### Set `kubectl` up with our credentials

```shell
kubectl config set-credentials $(kubectl config current-context) \
    --token $(cat ${GKE_NAME}_token.txt)
```

#### Add the GCR account to the Kubernetes provider

```shell
hal config provider kubernetes account add $GKE_NAME \
    --docker-registries my-gcr-account \
    --context $(kubectl config current-context)
```

#### Set Kubernetes as the provider for Halyard

```shell
hal config provider kubernetes enable

hal config deploy edit \
    --account-name $GKE_NAME \
    --type distributed
```

#### Use Halyard to deploy Spinnaker

It takes some time for Halyard to deploy Spinnaker into your Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
hal deploy apply
```

### Validate Basic Install

#### Forward the Spinnaker UI ports to your local machine

You need to do this part in two local Terminals (not the Cloud Shell). Leave
each command running. You can ctrl-C out of them whenever you don't want access
to the Spinnaker UI any more.

In Terminal #1:

```shell
DECK_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n spinnaker \
    -l load-balancer-spin-deck=true \
    -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl port-forward $DECK_POD 9000:9000 -n spinnaker
```

In Terminal #2:

```shell
GATE_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n spinnaker \
    -l load-balancer-spin-gate=true \
    -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

kubectl port-forward $GATE_POD 8084:8084 -n spinnaker
```

#### Test the Spinnaker UI

Connect to `http://localhost:9000` to access the Spinnakker UI
running within Kubernetes.

Make sure you can click on the Projects and Applications tabs at the top.

### Enable SSL

Run the rest of the SSL instructions on your Halyard VM. **Note:** if you
haven't made a self-signed cert before, make sure you keep track of all of the
passwords you enter in the following steps. It will make your life a lot easier.

```shell
gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b # <<-- [OR THE ZONE YOU USED]
gcloud compute ssh halyard-host
```

#### Create the Certificate Authority (CA) Key

```shell
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
```

#### Self-Sign the CA Certificate

```shell
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```

#### Create the Server Key

Keep this file safe!

```shell
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096
```

#### Create a Signing Request

Generate a certificate signing request for the server. Specify `localhost` or
Gateâ€™s eventual fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) as the Common Name (CN).

```shell
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
```

#### Sign the Request

Use the CA to sign the serverâ€™s request. If using an external CA, they will
do this for you.

```shell
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out server.crt
```

#### Format Server Certificate

Put the cert into a Java key store.

```shell
YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD=hunter2 # <<-- Replace with your password

openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in server.crt -inkey server.key -out \
  server.p12 -name spinnaker -password pass:$YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```

#### Create Java Keystore

```shell
keytool -keystore keystore.jks -import -trustcacerts -alias ca -file ca.crt
```

#### Import Server Certificate

```shell
keytool \
  -importkeystore \
  -srckeystore server.p12 \
  -srcstoretype pkcs12 \
  -srcalias spinnaker \
  -srcstorepass $YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD \
  -destkeystore keystore.jks \
  -deststoretype jks \
  -destalias spinnaker \
  -deststorepass $YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD \
  -destkeypass $YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```

#### Tell Halyard to use SSL for the Spinnaker API

```shell
KEYSTORE_PATH=keystore.jks

hal config security api ssl edit \
  --key-alias spinnaker \
  --keystore $KEYSTORE_PATH \
  --keystore-password \
  --keystore-type jks \
  --truststore $KEYSTORE_PATH \
  --truststore-password \
  --truststore-type jks

hal config security api ssl enable
```

#### Tell Halyard to use SSL for the Spinnaker UI

```shell
SERVER_CERT=server.crt
SERVER_KEY=server.key

hal config security ui ssl edit \
  --ssl-certificate-file $SERVER_CERT \
  --ssl-certificate-key-file $SERVER_KEY \
  --ssl-certificate-passphrase

hal config security ui ssl enable
```

#### Apply Changes

Lastly, apply your changes to Halyard.

```shell
hal deploy apply
```

### Set up DNS

#### Expose the Spinnaker Deck (UI) and Spinnaker Gate (API) services

Get the existing Kubernetes manifests and modify them to use load balancers that
expose port 443 (for SSL).

```shell
kubectl -n spinnaker get svc spin-deck -o yaml | \
  sed 's/port: 9000/port: 443/g' | \
  sed 's/\(^.[ ]\)type: ClusterIP/\1type: LoadBalancer/g' > spin-deck.yaml

kubectl -n spinnaker get svc spin-gate -o yaml | \
  sed 's/port: 8084/port: 443/g' | \
  sed 's/\(^.[ ]\)type: ClusterIP/\1type: LoadBalancer/g' > spin-gate.yaml
```

Now we replace the existing Kubernetes services with our load-balanced versions.

```shell
kubectl replace -f spin-deck.yaml

kubectl replace -f spin-gate.yaml
```

Now we need to wait while Kubernetes acquires external IP addresses for our new
load balancers. You can run `watch` and wait until you see both the spin-deck
and the spin-gate with external IPs.

```shell
watch 'kubectl get svc -n spinnaker | grep "NAME\|deck\|gate"'
```

#### Configure DNS to point to your new load balancers

**Note:** You can't run these on your Halyard VM. You need to run them on your
local machine.

**Note:** Here, we expect your DNS to be hosted within a Google Cloud Platform
project. In this example that project name is `yourdomain-shared-services`.

Let's get all of the required variables set up:

```shell
DNS_PROJECT=yourdomain-shared-services
ZONE_NAME=yourdomain-zone # <<-- Replace with yours
DNS_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com # <<-- Replace with yours
REGION=us-west1 # <<-- Replace with yours if you changed it
DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_DECK=spin-deck
DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_GATE=spin-gate

SPIN_DECK_IP=$(kubectl -n spinnaker get svc spin-deck \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')

SPIN_GATE_IP=$(kubectl -n spinnaker get svc spin-gate \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

Here, we set up and execute a transaction for modifying the zone file.

```shell
gcloud dns record-sets transaction start \
  --project $DNS_PROJECT \
  -z $ZONE_NAME

gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \
  --name="$DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_DECK.$DNS_DOMAIN." \
  --ttl=300 "$SPIN_DECK_IP" \
  --type=A \
  -z $ZONE_NAME

gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \
  --name="$DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_GATE.$DNS_DOMAIN." \
  --ttl=300 "$SPIN_GATE_IP" \
  --type=A \
  -z $ZONE_NAME

gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute \
  --project $DNS_PROJECT \
  -z $ZONE_NAME
```

After you execute the transaction, you'll notice that the transaction is
pending. It might take a short while before your DNS changes take effect.

```
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/yourdomain-shared-services/
managedZones/yourdomain-zone/changes/3].`
ID  START_TIME                STATUS
3   2018-06-08T16:50:57.812Z  pending
```

If you want to check for status change on the transaction, you can use `dig`.

```shell
watch dig "$DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_DECK.$DNS_DOMAIN"
```

Now, on your Halyard VM, configure Halyard to set the base URLs to be our new
DNS entries.

```shell
hal config security ui edit \
 --override-base-url https://$DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_DECK.$DNS_DOMAIN

hal config security api edit \
 --override-base-url https://$DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_GATE.$DNS_DOMAIN

hal deploy apply
```

### Validate SSL and DNS

Since we're using a self-signed cert, you'll need to add an exception in the web
browser for both the spin-gate and spin-deck subdomains. In a Chrome incognito
window, go to the URL created by this `echo` command:

```shell
echo $DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_GATE.$DNS_DOMAIN
```

Now, got to the URL created by this `echo` command:

```shell
echo $DNS_NAME_FOR_SPIN_DECK.$DNS_DOMAIN
```

### Enable OAuth

If you use OAuth, authentication to the Spinnaker UI can be accomplished via an
email address from your company's GSuite Organization.

**Note:** If you haven't installed SSL into your Spinnaker installation, you
should follow the below instructions but change the https:// to http:// when you
set the "Authorized redirect URIs".

For this step, you need to follow these
[instructions](https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/security/authentication/oauth/providers/google/)
to get your client ID and client secret. Make sure to open that URL in the same
window where you have GCP access.

#### SSH into your Halyard VM

```shell
PROJECT=[YOUR PROJECT THAT CONTAINS YOUR HALYARD MACHINE]
HALYARD_HOST=halyard-host
gcloud config set project $PROJECT
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b
gcloud compute ssh $HALYARD_HOST
```

#### Set up the environment

```shell
CLIENT_ID=[FROM THE PROCESS MENTIONED ABOVE]
CLIENT_SECRET=[FROM THE PROCESS MENTIONED ABOVE]
PROVIDER=google
```

#### Tell Halyard to allow for OAuth within Spinnaker

```shell

  --client-id $CLIENT_ID \

hal config security authn oauth2 enable

hal deploy apply
```

Wait for the `hal deploy apply` to complete.

### Validate OAuth

You can now test the OAuth login. Close all Chrome incognito browser windows
then open a new incognito window.  Navigate to the Spinnaker UI. If you are not
prompted to login, try
[clearing your browser history](chrome://settings/clearBrowserData)
for the last hour, or try using a different web browser (Safari, Firefox, etc).

### Set up the Sample app and Pipeline

#### Create sample-app source code repository

Do this in a local terminal.

1. Download the source code to your local machine

    ```shell
    wget https://gke-spinnaker.storage.googleapis.com/sample-app.tgz \
        --no-check-certificate
    ```

2. Unpack the source code

    ```shell
    tar xzfv sample-app.tgz
    ```

3. Change directories to the top of the sample-app dir

    ```shell
    cd sample-app
    ```

4. Make the initial commit to your source code repository

    ```shell
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

5. Create a source repository for your sample-app code

    ```shell
    gcloud source repos create sample-app
    git config credential.helper gcloud.sh
    ```

6. Set the remote for your repository

    ```shell
    PROJECT=[YOUR PROJECT ID HERE]
    git remote add origin \
       https://source.developers.google.com/p/$PROJECT/r/sample-app
    ```

7. Push your code to the newly-created source code repository

    ```shell
    git push origin master
    ```

#### Create a build trigger

1. In the GCP Console, click **Build Triggers** in the Container Registry
   section
2. In the GCP Console navigate to `Container Registry > Build Triggers`
3. Click **Create Trigger**
4. Select **Cloud Source Repository** and click **Continue**
5. Select the `sample-app` repository from the list and click **Continue**
6. Set the following trigger settings:
    * **Name:** sample-app-tags
    * **Trigger type:** Tag
    * **Tag (regex):** v.&ast;
    * **Build configuration:** cloudbuild.yaml
    * **cloudbuild.yaml location:** `/ cloudbuild.yaml`
7. Click **Create Trigger**

##### Here's the dialog filled-out:

![Create Trigger](img/spin-create-trigger.png)

From now on, whenever you push a Git tag prefixed with the letter "v" to your
source code repository, Container Builder automatically builds and pushes your
application as a Docker image to Container Registry.

#### Build your Docker image

The trigger we previously created will see new tags (that start with "v") and
will build a Docker image and store it in your Container Registry.

1. Create a git tag

    ```shell
    git tag v1.0.0
    ```

2. Push the tag to set-off the trigger

    ```shell
    git push --tags
    ```

3. In the Cloud Console, go to `Container Registry > Build History` to check
   that the build has been triggered. If not, verify the trigger was configured
   properly in the previous section.
   ![Build History](img/spin-buildhistory.png)

#### Create a deployment pipeline within Spinnaker

Using the Spinnaker application, we're going to create an application, create
the load balancers, and a pipeline.

##### Create the application

1. In the Spinnaker UI at (`http://localhost:9000`), click **Actions**, then
   click **Create Application**
   ![Create Application](img/spin-create-app.png)
2. In the New Application dialog, enter the following fields:
   * **Name:** sample
   * **Owner Email:** [your email address]
3. Click **Create**

![New Application](img/spin-new-app.png)

##### Create service load balancers

We use Kubernetes deployment files to set up the load balancers. They are
`.yaml` files under the `k8s/services` directory. Run the following commands
to create the services for sample-app. These resources are going to get created
in the spinnaker Kubernetes Engine cluster.

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s/services
```

##### Create the deployment pipeline

Next, you create the continuous delivery pipeline. In this tutorial, the
pipeline is configured to detect when a Docker image with a tag prefixed with
"v" has arrived in your Container Registry.

1. Run the following command to generate a properties file which defines the
   pipeline we want to deploy:

    ```shell
    sed s/PROJECT/$PROJECT/g spinnaker/pipeline-deploy.json | \
        sed 's/"local"/"spinnaker"/g' | \
        sed 's/"gcr"/"my-gcr-account"/g' > pipeline.json
    ```

2. In the Spinnaker UI at (`http://localhost:9000`) click on the application
   you created earlier (called sample).
3. Click on **Pipelines**
4. Click on **Configure a new Pipeline**
5. In the resulting dialog, enter:
    1. **Select Type**: Pipeline
    2. **Pipeline Name**: sample
6. Click on create.
7. Click on `Pipeline Actions > Edit as JSON`
    ![Edit JSON](img/edit-json.png)
8. Replace the JSON you see with the contents of the pipeline.json file we made
   in **Step 1** above.
9. Click on **Update Pipeline**
10. Click on **Save Changes**. You should see a pipleline like this:
    ![Deploy](img/spin-deploy.png)

### Validate the Sample App and Pipeline

The configuration you just created contains a trigger to start the pipeline
when you push a new Git tag containing the prefix "v". In this section of the
tutorial, you test the pipeline by running it manually.

1. Click **Start Manual Execution**
   ![Manual Start](img/spin-manualstart.png)
2. Select the v1.0.0 tag from the **Tag** drop-down list, then click **Run**
   ![Pipeline Execution](img/spin-execution.png)
3. After the pipeline starts, click **Details** to see more information about
   the build's progress. This section shows the status of the deployment
   pipeline and its steps. Steps in blue are currently running, green ones have
   completed successfully, and red ones have failed. Click a stage to see
   details about it.

#### Wait for Pipeline

It takes a while for the test phases to complete. Once they're done, it will
pause before a push to production. It requires human intervention to push into
production so:

1. Hover over the yellow "person" icon and click **Continue**.
   ![Push to Production](img/spin-push-to-prod.png)
2. After you press Continue, it will take a few minutes and then the pipeline
   will complete.
3. Hover over the **Infrastructure** item at the top of the screen and select
   **Load Balancers** from the drop-down.
   ![Load Balancer](img/spin-lb.png)
4. Click on the word **DEFAULT** in the sample-frontend-prod and look to the
   right afterward.
   ![Local](img/spin-local.png)
5. On the panel that appears to the right, there's a mention of **Ingress**.
   Click on that IP and it will bring you to the page. If it gives you an
   https:// URL, you will probably have to change it to http://.
   ![Internal DNS](img/spin-internal-dns.png)
6. You will see the result page (like the following image) that hit the backend
   to produce JSON and then the frontend rendered into HTML.
   ![Back end](img/spin-backend-orange.png)

## Tear Down

### Approach #1

Make sure you're in the correct project and zone

```shell
gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]
gcloud config set compute/zone [THE ZONE WITH YOUR RESOURCES]
```

Give Halyard a chance to delete its resources.

```shell
gcloud compute ssh halyard-host

# Run this on the Halyard VM
hal deploy clean
```

Now, exit from the Halyard VM so we can delete it.

This deletes the Kubernetes Engine resources and the Halyard Google Compute
Engine VM.

```shell
gcloud container clusters delete spinnaker
gcloud compute instances delete halyard-host
```

This removes the Spinnaker-related buckets. They contain applications,
pipelines, and projects.

```shell
gsutil rm -r $(gsutil ls gs:// | grep "gs://spin-" | xargs)
```

This removes the service accounts.

```shell
PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)

HALYARD_ID=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
  --filter="displayName:halyard-service-account" \
  --format='value(email)')

SPIN_ID=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
  --filter="displayName:spinnaker-storage-account" \
  --format='value(email)')

gcloud iam service-accounts delete $HALYARD_ID
gcloud iam service-accounts delete $SPIN_ID

gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
  --member "serviceAccount:$HALYARD_ID" \
  --role "roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"

gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
  --member "serviceAccount:$HALYARD_ID" \
  --role "roles/container.admin"

gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
  --member "serviceAccount:$SPIN_ID" \
  --role "roles/browser"

gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
  --member "serviceAccount:$SPIN_ID" \
  --role "roles/storage.admin"
```

The deletes the git repository for the sample application:

```shell
gcloud source repos delete sample-app
```

These are some other considerations:

1. If you configured DNS, you probably want to remove the entries you created.
2. The sample application uses Google Container Registry resources. You might
   want to leave them alone unless you know exactly what needs deleted.

### Approach #2

If you want to make sure you zero-out anything that could bill you, go to the
following menu item in the Cloud Console:

`IAM & admin > Manage resources`

Select your project and press the **delete** button.

## Troubleshooting

1. `hal deploy apply` will mark exceptions in red. Other `hal` commands will
   too.
2. Halyard configurations can be overwritten by following the Tear Down
   instructions and re-running the Halyard instructions again.
3. Make sure your `gcloud config set project $PROJECT` and `gcloud config set
   compute/zone $GKE_ZONE` commands are always set up before any command-line
   sessions you begin. If you're wondering what your current config looks like,
   use `gcloud config list`.
4. If you're having trouble running kubectl, make sure you've run `gcloud
   container clusters get-credentials spinnaker` after correctly setting your
   project.
5. If you go to the Spinnaker UI and it just shows the logo and spins
  endlessly, make sure you have the SSH tunnel to 8084 running.
6. If Halyard can't successfully bring up a new spin-deck or spin-gate after
   configuring SSL, it's likely that you entered an incorrect password for your
   keystore or certs.  You need to run those instructions again and do another
   `hal deploy apply --service-names deck,gate`.
